Certainly! Let's break down the calculation step by step:

Given information:
- Risk-Free Rate ($(R_f)$) = 4.0%
- Expected Return on the Market ($(R_m$)) = 13.0%
- Expected Return on Security J ($(R_J$)) = 25.3%

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula is:
$[ R_J = R_f + $beta $times (R_m - R_f) $]

1. Calculate the difference between the Expected Return on the Market and the Risk-Free Rate:
$[ R_m - R_f = 13.0$% - 4.0$% = 9.0$% $]

2. Substitute the values into the CAPM formula and solve for beta ($($beta$)):
$[ 25.3$% = 4.0$% + $beta $times 9.0$% $]

3. Subtract the Risk-Free Rate from the Expected Return on Security J:
$[ 25.3$% - 4.0$% = 21.3$% $]

4. Divide this result by the difference between the Expected Return on the Market and the Risk-Free Rate to find $($beta$):
$[ $beta = $frac{21.3$%}{9.0$%} $]

5. Calculate the value:
$[ $beta = 2.3667 $]

So, the beta for Security J is approximately 2.37.
